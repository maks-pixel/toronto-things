			<p>Shakespeare in High Park is an awesome way to spend an afternoon or evening being amongst the trees whisked away by some amazing theater. Every summer there are two wonderful Shakespearian plays put on by some amazing people from York university. This year's plays are "Romeo and Juliet" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream". To go see them its just pay what you can, from Tuesday to Sunday you can watch one or both of the plays in high park starting in July.

				<p id="tips">Here are some tips/recomendations, for having the best time:</p>
			</p>
			<ol id="list_s">
					<li id="list_s">Bring snacks! Bringing something to eat adds to the experience, and they dont sell food at the show. But you can find other places in the park that sells food.</li>
					<li id="list_s">Reserve a seat ahead of time or bring a pillow. The ground isnt supper comfortable to sit on after a while.</li>
					<li id="list_s">On colder nights bring a blanket or sweater. You are outside and it gets a little colder.</li>
					<li id="list_s">Treat it like a picnic.</li>
				</ol>
